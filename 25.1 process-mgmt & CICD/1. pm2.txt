1. create a new ec2 instance
2. run a express backend(node index.js) on ec2 machine after installing npm and all
3. now if you kill the process on the machine, the server will stop also, but pm2 will restart it.
4. to use pm2:
    sudo npm i -g pm2
    pm2 start index.js

    commands to understand:
        curl localhost:3000 - similar to postman but for terminal
        lsof -i :3000 -  this gives you the process id for a given port
        kill <PID>  - kill the process

        pm2 examples  - shows all the pm2 commands
        pm2 list  - shows all processes runnning with pm2
        pm2 delete app  - to stop the app process
