npx serve - local network address to serve all the files in a folder








Deploying backend apps using aws ec2 and nginx reverse proxies




create an instance on aws ec2
select instance type
key pair authentication system 
    itwill give the private key in downloads and put public key in ec2 machine
    whoever have the private key on their device only him can ssh into the machine

network setting:
security groups - which ports are open
    port 22 open for SSHing into machine (from anyone who has private key)
    type as TCP for running http server


to check default ssh/rsa keys:
    ls ~/.ssh

ssh into the machine:
    1. move pem file in root dir, then Give ssh key permissions
    chmod 700 mohitPrivateKey.pem          //700 = Owner can do everything, NO ONE else can do anything.

    2. ssh into machine
    ssh -i mohitPrivateKey.pem ubuntu@<public ip or domain>

    3. Clone repo
    git clone https://github.com/mohit/sum-server

    If your aws machine shows you the following error, your aws machine doesn’t have access to the internet

    4. Install Node.js💡
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
                    source - https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-20-04
    after that:
        export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
        source ~/.bashrc
        nvm install --lts

    5. Install all dependencies
    cd sum-server
    npm install

    6. Start backend
    node index.js
    make sure the server port running on and the port opened in instance are same.
    
now go to publicip:port   and its deployed, its not in https but in http

http defaault port is 80,  so, http://publicip === http://publicip:80
https defaault port is 443,  so, https://publicip === https://publicip:443
so that we dont need to specify port in the url, but we cant run anything on 80 or 443, also only one service can run on it.
so we use NGINX for reverse proxing.
