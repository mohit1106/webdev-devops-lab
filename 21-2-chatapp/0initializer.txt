initialise monorepo

how to create ui components and reuse them in different apps
exports
chat app frontend

added ws-server and http-server
initialized package.json in both apps
put common tsconfig.json in typescript-config in backends.json
then modify tsconfig.json of servers to extend from typescript-config
also put outDir and rootdir paths in each tsconfig.json
modify package.json to have dev and build scripts 



exploring  turbo.json. its build inputs and outputs and cache

for express backends build - so that the dist folder is considered as final output of that backend app
overwrite global turbo.json in specific app by creating another turbo.json in that app(here ws-server)
add this:   {
                "extends": ["//"],
                "tasks": {
                  "build": {
                    "outputs": ["dist/**"]
                  }
                }
            }


similarly react app also builds its final files in dist, so add overriding turbo.json just inside that react-app
